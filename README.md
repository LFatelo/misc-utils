# misc-utils
Miscellaneous scripts for automating miscellaneous tasks  
All scripts in here are **works in progress**  
In the near-future all of the functionality within these scripts will most likely be merged into larger Ansible playbooks.

**freebsdinitialization.sh**  
A simple script that will install on a FreeBSD host useful tools. Optionally it may also install HTTP and FTP servers.

**rhinit.sh**  
A script that essentially functions as a toolbox for Red Hat based hosts. It currently contains options to install and start up HTTP and FTP services.

**debmodder.sh**  
A script based assistant for Debian systems. Please note that this script is still under heavy development and some features are still missing and will be added in the future.
